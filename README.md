# FoodTruck-Group3

For our group project we'll be  building a PHP application that allows a user to select 
items from a menu as if they are ordering from a food truck.

This application can: 
    - Allow items to be chosen from a form
    - Display the items chosen and add and display the total cost
    - Allow more than one of each item to be purchased
